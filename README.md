# Isaiah's Parade, a multi-purpose Discord bot

## Description
Isaiah's Parade is a multi-purpose discord bot that focuses on providing features for both mods and regular server members. With a wide array of commands available, members can manage, and enjoy themselves with the unique features. Very little of Isaiah's Parade can be found elsewhere, as I strived to make this bot personally generalized, with a custom touch every where you look. This bot is still in continous development from fixing up few features and expanding it to make everything more efficient and user friendly.


## Getting Isaiah's Parade
Currently, getting him is out of the option due to as my current setup can't handle too much stress. However, you can gain full accessibility to him by joining the main server using the below link:
[The Parade Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5szJdKY "The official Discord Server for Isaiah's Parade")

### Usage
Upon joining The Parade, you will be given a "Follower" role. This is unique to this server only along with a few other features such as naturally occuring raids.

His command prefix is <> and you can view his help by doing <>help {category name}. On doing <>help alone, He will tell you a list of available categories, those being General, Misc, Gaming, Battle, Moderator, Actions and Socials
