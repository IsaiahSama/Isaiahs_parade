# Isaiah's Parade, a multi-purpose Discord bot

## Description
Isaiah's Parade is a Discord Bot created by me, Isaiah Carrington, to be a bot made initially for Moderation using the Discord API<br> Since the beginning, we have gone beyond, expanding our scope to cover some word games, quests, raids with people from other servers, social profiles and more.

<br>
Currently, there are 7 categories for you as a Discord user to choose from.

## Getting Isaiah's Parade
Currently, getting him is out of the option due to as my current setup can't handle too much stress. However, you can gain full accessibility to him by joining the main server using the below link:
[The Parade Discord Server](https://discord.gg/5szJdKY "The official Discord Server for Isaiah's Parade")

### Usage
Upon joining The Parade, you will be given a "Follower" role. This is unique to this server only along with a few other features such as naturally occuring raids.

His command is <> and you can view his help by doing <>help {category name}. On doing <>help alone, He will tell you a list of available categories, those being General, Misc, Gaming, Battle, Moderator, Actions and Socials
