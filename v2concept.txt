    Requirements:
        User must be below 40% health
        Can only be used once per fight

Running:
    The chance to escape will be determined as follows:
        1) The health of the player is subtracted from the health of the enemy, and the absolute value is used.
        2) 100 is then added to this value.
        3) The random calculator will take in a list of numbers from 0-99, and the percentage chance will be the modulus of the value above when divided by 100
        Example:
            If the player had 420 health, and the enemy had 360. The subtraction would be:
            1)    360 - 420 = -60
                As the absolute value is used, this will just be 60. 

            2) Adding 100, will then make this 160
            3) 160 % 100 will give a remainder of 60. This means the player has a 60% chance of successfully running.
